For p1, pass the filepath as a command-line argument. The output will be
displayed in 'out.txt'. Note that the program must be able to create the
file 'out.txt'.

For p2, call the Filter function by passing it two arguments: 1) A function
that returns a boolean on an int64, and 2) a collection of int64 values. It
will return a slice of int64s that meet the criteria.

For p2, call the Map function by passing it two arguments: 1) A function
that maps an int64 to an int64, and 2) a collection of int64 values. It will
return the function mapped over all values.
