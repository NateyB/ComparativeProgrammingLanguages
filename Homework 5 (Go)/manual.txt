The flags to run this program are as follows:
The flag "l" takes an int, and is the length of a sequence.
The flag "n" takes an int, and is the number of sequences to generate.
The flag "ks" takes the list of motif lengths separated by spaces as a string.
The flag "cs" takes the list of the number of motif mutations per motif separated by spaces as a string.
The flag "m" takes the minimum number of motifs.
The flag "I" specifies the length of the active sub-region in the sequence.

Example:
./Homework5 -l=25 -n=50 -ks="10 15" -cs="1 1" -m=1 -I=100


Templates are output to the file "out.txt", and sequences with
motif information are output to "seq.dat"
